## Interview preparation

### Dan Pupius - Whiteboarding

some common pitfalls that can be avoided:

* **Slow-down**, chill-out, and try to write as neatly as possible. This will help you stay organized and focused and will also helps the interviewer understand whether the code actually does what it is meant to.
* **Ask questions**. The interview is as much about the how you get to the answer as the answer itself.
* **Code how you’d normally code**
* **Check your work**, when you think you are done. (run sample input to test termination cases/unusual inputs/edge cases. Think about how you would unit test the code and write them up on the board)
* **Practice** coding some stuff on the whiteboard, then take your code and see if it actually runs; learn from what didn’t work.
* **Research** about the company beforehand (to be able to answer Qs like "why do you want to work here")
* **Have fun** (As well as seeing whether you are capable, the interviewer is also looking to see if they would want to work with you)


### [coderust] Effective Whiteboarding

* Use the corner of the whiteboard for **notes and requirements, answers to clarifying questions**

* **Write Clearly**

* **Use the Space Efficiently**. When you start writing code for problems, remember that most interview problem solutions span at least 15 – 20 lines of code. You need to make enough room for this much content.

* **Edits are part of the game** Don’t be afraid to change code.

* **Practice!** Consider practicing on whiteboard an important part of your preparation along with studying for algorithmic and design problems.
